Canalis Hydra 12 is a musical project created by Raileythropvest1972, a SoundCloud user who mixes different genres and styles to create unique tracks. The project consists of 12 songs that explore themes such as love, adventure, mystery and fantasy. Each song has its own mood and atmosphere, ranging from upbeat and energetic to calm and relaxing.
 
The name Canalis Hydra 12 comes from the idea of combining different musical elements into one cohesive whole, like a hydra with multiple heads. Raileythropvest1972 says that he wanted to challenge himself and experiment with different sounds and influences. He also says that he was inspired by the Microsoft Sway presentation software, which he used to create a visual accompaniment for his project.
